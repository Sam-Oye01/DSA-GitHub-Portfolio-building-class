This is where I started my portfolio building while taking my data analysis class with the Incubator Hub.

I have learnt quite a number of things rangng from Ms Excel to SQL and now to portfolio building.

## Project Topic: E-commerce Sales Analysis

### Project Overview 
This Data Analysis project aims to generate insights into the sales performance of the E-comerce project over the past year. By analysing the various parameters in the data received, we seek to gather enough insight to make reasonable decisions which can help us to tell compelling stories around our data from the insight gotten as well as to know the best performance from our data.   

### Data Source
The primary source of data used here is Data Sale.csv and this is an open source data that can be freely downloaded from an open source online platform such as kaggle or FRED or any other data repository site.

### Tools Used
- Ms Excel [Download here](https://www.bing.com/aclick?ld=e8m4Wk4KFBGo39P6ViwW1rmjVUCUwpv5j6NgsNiqiVf59ZAblqSSiXGaTrzFnosGVlCj5HXo6vyjcX5v09Xy9uuJDQtVCaPkFvKnGF0XulpVcFxAcT2WdC6gszTi_XUfzoRV5Fa-NlRn4tpH3mbi0pZA4tAaAjxz4nqMJF3D9aAcLRF_ymryV7f44pIOoL1XjovHqA6A&u=aHR0cHMlM2ElMmYlMmZ3d3cuYXBwY3JhY3kuY29tJTJmYXBwJTJmbWljcm9zb2Z0LWV4Y2VsLXNwcmVhZHNoZWV0cy5odG1sJTNmbXNjbGtpZCUzZGVhYzUzMThlOWUzMzEzZWI1OGJjNTliNzU1OTRhNGQ5JTI2Y2MlM2QxNjk5MjE0ODklMjZudyUzZG8&rlid=eac5318e9e3313eb58bc59b75594a4d9)
    - For Data Collection.
    - For Data Cleaning.
        - Data Manipulation.
        - Data Munching.
- SQL server (for Querying and Analysis).
- Power BI (for creating a report).
- Ms Power Point (for Presentation).

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
1. Data Loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing variables.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved the exploring of the data to answer some questions about the data such as;
- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which products are top sellers?
- What are the products on peak sales?

### Data Analytics
This is where we include some basic lines of code or queries or even some of the DAX expressions used during your analysis

```  SQL  ```

    SELECT A, B, C from Sales
